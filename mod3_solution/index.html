  						The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

						Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1,[2] or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
